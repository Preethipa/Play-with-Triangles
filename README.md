# Play-with-Triangles

Welcome to my profilio! I make this triangle app by using JavaScript, HTML and CSS learned from neog.camp.
Using this app, which can help you to learn about the triangles.

The below text is to explain my project detials.

problem statement:
Ask the user to input three angles and you say whether the angles make a triangle or not.
Prepare a Quiz and enable the user to play the quiz and calculate scores based on the answers chosen by the user.
Calculate hypotenuse of a triangle given the other two sides
Calculate area of a triangle given the base and height of a triangle


This app built with VanillaJS by using Visual Studio Code.

Create a nine seperate file for Find triangle, quiz, area and hypotenuse.

Program for Find the Triangle:

Step-1: create input for three angles.
Step-2: Add button.
Step-3:  Calculate sum of angles 
Step-4: Check sum of angles is equal to 180 degree.
Step-5: Put div to show output.

Program for quiz a Triangle:

Step-1: create a form.
Step-2: Add button.
Step-3: Use querySelector. 
Step-4: Check value is equal to Correct answer and incremented by 1
Step-5: Put.div to show output.

Program for calculate hypotenuse:

Step-1: create two inputs.
Step-2: Add button.
Step-3: Use querySelector to call input 
Step-4: Create function to calculate the length of the hypotenuse
            c = sqrt(a*a + b*b)
Step-5: Putd iv to show output.

Program for calculate Area:

Step-1: create two inputs.
Step-2: Add button.
Step-3: Use querySelector to call input 
Step-4: Create function to calculate the area of the triangle
            c = 1/2(base * height)
Step-5: Put div to show output.
